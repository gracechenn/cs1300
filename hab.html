                <h3> Introduction </h3>
                <p>
                    Hack@Brown is Brown University's annual hackathon that welcomes high schoolers and college students around the world. Each year, we choose a playful theme like "Afterschool" or "Greenhouse" to encourage students of all backgrounds to join.
                </p>
                
                <h3> In 2022, I led the design team to create a brand identity for Brown's annual Hackathon ‚Äì including art direction, web design, illustrations, and social media. </h3>

                <h3>Each year, we choose a playful theme to encourage students of all backgrounds to join. "Greenhouse" represents a safe space where students can grow and it hopes to center the event around eco-friendly hacks.
                </h3>

                <h3> Not only do we encourage hackers to learn, but everyone on our design team joins with no prior knowledge of how to 3D model.</h3>

                <p> We used vibrant colors and simplified 3D illustrations to create an immersive website homepage.
